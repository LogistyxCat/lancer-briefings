Born:  November 30, 4999u  
Birthplace:  Illume, San Simeon  
Occupation:  Student of Karrakin Calvary College (KCC)  
Biography:  
  Live birth from Metyr and Odira Calystrix.  Parents and immediate family are currently employed at varying positions within Lodestar System’s higher echelons, a native Simian project and systems engineering company that provides large project-based engineering solutions to other companies. Oriana is fourth child among three biological siblings, aged 5, 7 and 8 years older than her. Confirmed extended family and business history with House of Water and a select number environmental conservation companies.  
  Parents feature consistent presence through Oriana’s childhood with multiple social as well as workplace events reported to have Oriana’s attendance.  According to sources, these events and participation were extracurricular and did not often interfere with education.  Nevertheless Oriana’s social life outside of school was impacted at times, although notes confirm that the events and work days Oriana was brought to provided exposure to Karrakin Trade Baronies (KTB) customs and individuals prior to attendance to KCC.  
  NDA for both parties of the Project ensure limited discussion, but it is necessary to note Oriana played a role as participant in certain project commissioned to Lodestar Systems that involved close collaboration and interaction with EUSEBIA.  Statements suggest continued interactions with Oriana offered more stable mental functioning for EUSEBIA and thus Oriana’s socializations increasingly adjusted to the family’s workplace and the NHP.

According to interview with Metyr and Odira Calystrix, word of mouth from Baronic clients lead the Calystrix family to learn of the House of Order preparing sponsorships to potential mech pilots.  Parents went on to state in interview that both of their older children already hold experience and interest in continuing business in Lodestar Systems leaving less pressure on Oriana to follow suit, and thus fully support her interest in attending the College.  The family claims Oriana has a strong love for San Simeon and holds a sense of pride to see the planet enter the Baronic world in official terms as the prospective House of Promise.

In-house assessments confirm Oriana’s requirements for attendance to the KCC are met.  Procedures are underway to invite Oriana Calystrix to the KCC.

    [31.5.5017u]  
    Upon informing EUSEBIA of upcoming attendance to KCC, word-of-mouth accounts  
    claim that the NHP did not take the news through expected means as mourning or expressing  
    sadness.  Witness accounts state EUSEBIA told Oriana, “Take me with you”, followed by  
    monitoring screens going dark and all communications and monitoring/recording systems  
    ceasing to function for 5 minutes and 19 seconds.  During that time frame, the room was  
    locked preventing execution of established safety procedures.  No record of what occurred  
    during the Blackout Time could be located.  Oriana herself could not recall what had taken  
    place, and EUSEBIA disturbingly refuses to elaborate.  No vital or psychological influence  
    is detected after the Blackout Event but Oriana insists that EUSEBIA would have no intention  
    of bringing harm.  At time of reporting this, there are no suggested means for follow-up and  
    no signs of cascading that fall within expected parameters.
